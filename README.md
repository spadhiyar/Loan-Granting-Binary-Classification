# Loan-Granting-Binary-Classification
In this competition, you must explore and cleanse a dataset consisting of over 255,000 loan records to determine the best way to predict whether a loan applicant will fully repay or default on a loan. You must then build a machine learning model and publish it as a web service that returns the unique loan ID and a loan status label that indicates whether the loan will be fully paid or charged off.
