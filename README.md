# Loan-Granting-Binary-Classification

# Microsoft Cortana Challenge

This competition concerns loan data. When a customer applies for a loan, banks and other credit providers use statistical models to determine whether or not to grant the loan based on the likelihood of the loan being repaid. The factors involved in determining this likelihood are complex, and extensive statistical analysis and modelling are required to predict the outcome for each individual case. You must implement a model that predicts loan repayment or default based on the data provided.

In this competition, you must explore and cleanse a dataset consisting of over 255,000 loan records to determine the best way to predict whether a loan applicant will fully repay or default on a loan. You must then build a machine learning model and publish it as a web service that returns the unique loan ID and a loan status label that indicates whether the loan will be fully paid or charged off.

The dataset can be downloaded as a csv file by clicking here and a description of the attributes of the dataset can be obtained here.
